# ECSE 443
ECSE 443 or Introduction to Numerical Methods is a course taught to mainly students persuing electrical engineering profession at McGill University. It builds atop the foundational continuous and discrete mathematics of engineering curricula, as well as basic expertise in algorithm design and development. Its high-level goal is to bridge concepts from applied mathematics to engineering applications, through the lens of numerical computation.
